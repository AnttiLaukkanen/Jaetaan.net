When I started to write code to this Jaetaan.net
I had never coded before.

In  two years and three months I learnt something
but there is still left some code that is not so good.

Now I would make it all in English and I would use Finnish only 
when needed for finnish end users so that the code would benefit 
anybody anywhere in the world.

Now it's partly in Finnish partly in English.

All the works well and it is sometimes rather easy to read too 
but it's not always so clean and neat, 
not always as easy to read as it could be.

I hope you can read it anyway and I'm sure you can.

It's all free code for everybody anywhere and for any purpose.

Jaetaan.net has no any kind of host at the moment.
No technical, no content, no user finder.

It is waiting for someone to come and take it further.

If you think you or your group can take over and take it further, please contact
